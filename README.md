# 👋 Hey, I'm Leonardo

**Full-Stack Developer | React • Node.js • Systems Automation** 


##  About Me

I am a Fullstack Developer with a focus on building high-performance interfaces and automated infrastructures.
I specialize in React and TypeScript, crafting UIs that are not only smooth and reliable but also backed by solid, scalable architectures.

What sets me apart is my approach to the full application lifecycle. I don't just stop at the code: 

I use Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform & Ansible) to provision and secure the environments where my apps live. 
Whether it's optimizing a React component or hardening a Linux server, I focus on delivering solutions that are stable, testable, and production-ready.
